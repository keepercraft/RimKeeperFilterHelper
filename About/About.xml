This mod adds several features that can help you manage storage and filters. 
Each functionality can be disabled or changed in the mod settings window.
Tried to make the mod clear and easy to use, and not to slow down the game's performance.
I will add more functionality in the future. 

Currently, the mod adds functionality:

- Storage filter tabs to save and copy filters between saves. 
- Resize by dragging the storage filter window. 
- Quickly select/deselect items in the filter window.

Let me know if you find any incompatibility or have an idea for adding functionality.
